# node-promptgen

Generate prompts for AI analysis of your Node.js projects.

## Description

`node-promptgen` is a command-line tool that extracts code, project structure, and dependencies from your Node.js projects. It creates a comprehensive prompt that can be used with AI language models (like ChatGPT) to gain insights into your project's purpose, structure, potential improvements, and more.
